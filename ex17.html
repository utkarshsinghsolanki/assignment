	<h1>Let Us C</h1>
	<p>
		Communicating with a computer involves speaking the language 
		the computer understands, which immediately rules out English as 
		the language of communication with computer. However, there is
		a close analogy between learning English language and learning C 
		language. The classical method of learning English is to first learn 
		the alphabets used in the language, then learn to combine these
		alphabets to form words, which in turn are combined to form
		sentences and sentences are combined to form paragraphs. 
		Learning C is similar and easier. Instead of straight-away learning 
		how to write programs, we must first know what alphabets, 
		numbers and special symbols are used in C, then how using them 
		constants, variables and keywords are constructed, and finally how 
		are these combined to form an instruction. A group of instructions 
		would be combined later on to form a program.
	</p>
	<p>
		The alphabets, numbers and special symbols when properly 
		combined form constants, variables and keywords. Let us see what 
		are ‘constants’ and ‘variables’ in C. A constant is an entity that 
		doesn’t change whereas a variable is an entity that may change. 
		In any program we typically do lots of calculations. The results of 
		these calculations are stored in computers memory. Like human 
		memory the computer memory also consists of millions of cells. 
		The calculated values are stored in these memory cells. To make 
		the retrieval and usage of these values easy these memory cells 
		(also called memory locations) are given names. Since the value 
		stored in each location may change the names given to these 
		locations are called variable names.
